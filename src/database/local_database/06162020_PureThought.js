const text = ['I would like to talk about the concept of pure thought.  It is something which I have just thought of, but I do not know whether I have heard of it before, or if I created the idea myself.  However, now that I write these words, I realize that it is definitely not something I created.  Again, I digress - let us return to the concept of pure thought','My idea of pure thought can be described in the following anecdote: Imagine a human being who has not come into contact with any other human being.  The notable aspect of this human is that his thoughts have never been influenced by another human being.  If this human were to live its life without ever learning ideas, theories, stories, etc. from other humans, what would his thoughts consist of?  If it were able to study the world like an academic and engage in philosophy, what sorts of things would it philosophize?','Looking at the written history of mankind, it is evident that there have been different ideas and views, depending on where those humans were in the world.'];
