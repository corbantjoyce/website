After a quick contemplation, I do not think life could exist without problems.  Without problems, there would be no opportunity to overcome challenges.  And if nothing ever overcame challenges, then life would never evolve and human consciousness as we know it would not exist.','From an omniscient point of view, the things that humans view as challenges would actually just be a sequence of events that humans want to happen in order for them to get something else.  I guess it would make sense for this to be an evolutionary trait.'];
