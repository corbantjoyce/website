const text = ['I recently had a dream that I was the President of the United States.  When I woke up, I thought about what it was like to be President in that dream.  After some contempliation, I realized that the dream felt more like a nightmare.','I started thinking about some of the things that a president would have to go through. For instance, at election time, roughly 50% of the population does not like you. Depending on how well you do, the obstacles thrown at you, and other circumstances, that percentage of the population that does not like you will fluctuate between 30 and 70 percent. In my life right now, I am pretty accustomed to feeling like the vast majority of people around me like me.  This percentage could range from 90 to 99 percent.  I admit these figures are not backed statistically at all, but I feel that most people would agree with this statement.  I will try to phrase it more another way, which may be more concise and simpe: as a regular civilian, you experience positive interactions with the people around you than you would as the President of the United States.  I would imagine that this variance of general attitude toward you would impact your mental health and well-being.'];
