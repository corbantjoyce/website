const text = ['Golden voting takes the concept of quadratic voting and combines it with the Fibonacci sequence.  In a blog post by Vitalik Buterin, titled >>"Quadratic Voting: A Primer">>, he presents an concept of decentralized governance which can be applied in ways outside of governance.  My intent with Golden Voting is to present a corollary of Quadratic Voting.  In order to understand what I mean by golden voting, I strongly recommend reading Vitalik"s blog post before you read any .','First, I will give a brief recap of my understanding of quadratic voting, its foundations, and its applications.  Consider two different ideologies of influence - both are related to "the public sphere", meaning that I am talking about public goods and, more generally, things that humans share.  The first ideology is one where an individual "buys influence" depending on how much they value the public good.  The result of this in practice is typically extremely biased.  That is to say, if you value a public good a lot, you are willing to invest a lot into it.  What you invest could vary (time, money, capital, etc.), so we will use money as our example.  Within the confines of this ideology, the result is that many people do not care enough about the public good to invest anything, but some people who care a lot are willing to invest a lot.  Vitalik shows this relationship between value and influence with the graph below.  The relationship is reminiscent of raw capitalism; and as we have seen in our own society, paying for influence heavily favors those who have a lot.  So in this ideology, rich people who care a lot and have a lot of money can control the public goods.  This results in a concentration of public goods in the favor of a select few.','The second ideology is again related to "buying influence", but instead of the capitalistic approach, we see equal representation from each individual.  In short, it is "one individual, one vote" - a familiar concept in modern democracies.  Instead of each individual having influence directly tied to their capital, their influence is tied to their individuality.  Again, this concept is common in modern society, but it has its shortfalls as well.  It gives the same influence to individuals who know none or care none about a particular public good as those who know everything and care deeply about it.  Vitalik describes this succinctly with the graph below.','Is there a way that individuals can increase their influence over public goods beyond others, but in a balanced way?','After presenting these two ideologies, Vitalik proposes "quadratic voting", which is meant to be a happy in-between option compared to the two previous ideologies.  He summarizes the first option as "one dollar, one vote", the second option as "one person, one vote", and then begins to describe quadratic voting.  Basically, quadratic voting is "one vote, one dollar", but then "second vote, two dollar", then "third vote, three dollar", and so on.  The cost of one"s hundredth vote would be one hundred dollars. The cost of additional votes by individuals increases.  You can see how this answers the question of how we can give additional influence to those who value something highly, but in a balanced way.  It would be wrong to ignore the fact that a member of the "super rich" would still have more influence over an individual in poverty.  However, this ideology curbs the effect of wealth and capital on centralizing decisions.  Vitalik gives a graph to show the cost of votes and then a graphical summary of all three ideologies.','I like the idea of quadratic voting because I think it has good intentions.  However, I think it falls short of capturing its target audience, which of course is the public.  The linear relationship between dollars and votes does not represent the wealth distribution in the world.  I believe the distribution needs to be more heavily biased toward the single dollar, i.e. give more power to the single voters and less power to those with incredible wealth.  Instead of increasing the cost of the next vote by one dollar, I propose increasing the cost of the next vote by the cost of the previous vote.  The cost sequential votes in dollars then become 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55... which of course is the Fibonacci sequence.  In this model, the sixth vote is 13 dollars instead of 6 dollars - already over double the cost of the quadratic voting model after 6 votes. As the Fibonnacci sequence approaches infinity, ratio of the next number to the current number (n+1:n) is called the "Golden Ratio", which is roughly 1.618.  Both this sequence and ratio are common and well-known because of their reappearance in mathematics and in nature.','As a fan of both mathematics and nature, I find value in this eloquent phenomenon.  As it appears in nature, the golden ratio has already proven to be a foundation of the world in which we live.  So, aside from accomplishing the goal of decreasing the influence of individuals of higher means, this model also fits well into the nature of the world.'];
