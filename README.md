# Website

My website showcases my stuff and allows me to practice my software skills.

The website uses React as a frontend framework and I try to use Material-UI as much as possible as a CSS framework.

## To run locally

1. Clone the repo
```
% git clone https://github.com/corbantjoyce/website.git
```

2. Open the main folder
```
% cd website
```

3. Start the server
```
% npm run start
```

Note: If you don't have `npm` installed, you may have to do so: https://www.npmjs.com/
